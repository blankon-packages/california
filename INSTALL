    Building & Installing California
    --------------------------------

  * Building

    To build California, run the following commands:

        $ ./configure
        $ make

    By default, California will install under /usr/local.  The configure script
    can customize the prefix directory.  Run ./configure --help for
    instructions and other installation options.


  * Running

    If you wish to try California before installing it, you may execute it directly
    from its build directory:

        $ src/california

    Note that certain desktop integration (such as being listed in an
    application menu) requires full installation.


  * Installing

    After California has built, run the following command to install it:

        $ sudo make install

    To uninstall, run:

        $ sudo make uninstall
